                        Restrictions
                        <br>
                        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                        individually.
                        To the full extent permitted by law,<br>
                        (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;<br>
                        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or
                        to utilize class action procedures;<br>
                        (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative

                        Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
                        <br>
                        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
                        informal

                        then neither Party will
                        elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
                        or unenforceable and such
                        Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
